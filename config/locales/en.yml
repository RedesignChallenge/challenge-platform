  about:
    our_mission: "Our Mission"
    welcome: "Welcome to the %{platform}.  You are essential to our success! Our mission is to bring educators together in an engaged online community that inspires breakthrough ideas in teaching and learning. The %{platform} offers educators a place to share experiences, exchange ideas and refine new approaches to old problems. The %{platform} will help educators find a precise understanding about why things don’t work in K-12 education and respond quickly to find solutions."
    our_solution: "Our Solution"
    solution: "The %{platform} is an open dialogue between those who often make the decisions and those who have to live with those decisions. Conversations will be guided by experienced educators.  Participants will focus on one theme, or “challenge,” at a time. Our first challenge is to help make videos for professional learning more relevant and useful to educators. All educators – from the classroom teacher to district superintendent – are invited to participate. The %{platform} community will determine the best ideas and pick subsequent challenges."
